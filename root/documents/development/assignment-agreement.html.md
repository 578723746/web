## WiX Toolset Assignment Agreement

The WiX toolset copyright is held by the [Outercurve Foundation](http://www.outercurve.org/) alone. The single copyright holder provides a number of legal advantages for the project. To maintain the single copyright holder over the project, all contributors must sign an assignment agreement with the Outercurve Foundation. Fortunately the assignment process is very easy. Just follow these steps:

1. If you don't have a GitHub account, create one.

2. Go [here](/development/assignment-agreement/login/?returnUrl=/development/assignment-agreement/request/) to authorize the WiX Toolset Web site to access your GitHub account information.

3. Click the link to send the information to Outercurve Foundation, which will provide an electronic document that you (and possibly your employer) need to sign.

4. You (and, if necessary, a representative from your employer) electronically sign the document.

While this process is underway you can participate in design discussions and actually write code. However, your code cannot be merged into the WiX toolset until the assignment agreement is in place.
