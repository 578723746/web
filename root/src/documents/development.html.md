## WiX Toolset Development

To get started as a developer we recommend walking through the following steps. You can do them in parallel although all of them need to be completed before your first submission can be commited.

1. Join the [wix-devs mailing list](/documentation/mailinglist).

2. Sign the [WiX toolset Assignment Agreement](/development/assignment-agreement/).

3. Enlist in the Git repository on GitHub for [WiX v3.x](http://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3) or [WiX v4.x](http://github.com/wixtoolset/wix4).

Once those are complete, you're ready to participate in the WiX toolset development lifecycle.

1. Discuss your idea for contribution on the [wix-devs mailing list](/documentation/mailinglist).

2. If it aligns with the project's goals, write the code and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

3. If the code meets all the requirements we'll accept it and merge it into the project.
